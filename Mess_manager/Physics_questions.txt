Q. 01. A ball hits a wall horizontally at 7m/s. It rebounds horizontally at 4m/s. The ball is in contact with the wall for 0.02s. What is the acceleration of the ball?

Q. 02. A car is travelling at 40 m/s along a road. A child runs out into the road 50 m ahead and the car driver steps on the brake pedal. What must the car’s deceleration be if the car is to stop just before it reaches the child?

Q 03. If a car travels first 40km at speed of 20km/h and next 80km at a speed of 40km/h. What is the average speed of car during journey?

Q.04. A police jeep is chasing velocity of 45 km/h. A thief in another jeep moving with a velocity of 153 km/h. police fires a bullet with muzzle velocity of 180 m/s the velocity it will strike the car of the thief is?

Q. 05.A bullet hits a Sand box with a velocity of 20 m/s and penetrates it up to a distance of 6 cm. Find the deceleration of the bullet in the sand box.

Q. 06.An Aeronautics engineer is designing the runway for an airport. Of the planes that will use the airport, the lowest acceleration rate is likely to be 3 m/s2. The take off speed for this plane will be 65 m/s. Assuming this minimum acceleration, what is the minimum allowed length for the runway?

Q. 07.A bullet leaves a rifle with a muzzle velocity of 521 m/s. While accelerating through the barrel of the riffle, the bullet moves a distance of 0.840 m. Determine the acceleration of the bullet (assume a uniform acceleration).

Q. 08.A baseball is popped straight up into the air and has a hang- time of 6.25 s. Determine the height to which the ball rises before it reaches its peak. (Hint: the time to rise to the peak is one- half the total hang-time.)

Q. 09.An air-plane accelerates down a runway at 3.20 m/s2 for 32.8 s until is finally lifts off the ground. Determine the distance travelled before take off.

Q. 10.A Truck covers 30km at a uniform speed of 30km/hr. what should be its speed for the next 90km if the average speed for the entire journey is 60km/h?

Q. 11.A train is travelling at a speed of 60 km/ h. Brakes are applied so as to produce a uniform acceleration of −0.5 m /s2. Find how far the train will go before it is brought to rest.

Q. 12.A cyclist moving on a circular track of radius 50m completes one revolution in 4 minutes. What is his
(a) average speed
(b) average velocity in one full revolution?
